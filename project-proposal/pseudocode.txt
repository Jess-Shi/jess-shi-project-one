// MVP 1 - Add all product data to Firebase (images, price, title, etc).

    // Create a file (firebase.js) to configure and export the Firebase object.



// MVP 2 - Display the number of items currently added to the user's cart.

    // Import the database object, and any required Firebase modules at the top of the main app file (app.js).

    // Call getDatabase() and ref() to create a reference to the Firebase database.

    // Add product IDs to the corresponding add-to-cart buttons in the HTML

    // Add event listeners to the cart buttons

        // When the buttons are clicked, add the products with the corresponding ID to the cart
        // Increase the count on the shopping bag as users add items to it
        // Change the inCart property of the products in the database to true


// MVP 3 - Allows users to view what has been added to their cart.

    // Create a popup with details of the products added to the cart (and a checkout button!)
        
        // Automatically add the price of all items in the cart and display the subtotal
        // Add an input field that allows the user to increase (or decrease) the amount of each item in cart
        // Add a trashcan for each product that allows the user to delete the product completely
